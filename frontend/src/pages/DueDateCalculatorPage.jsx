                  How accurate is due date calculator using Naegele's rule?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Due date calculators using Naegele's rule achieve 95% accuracy within a 2-week window, making it 
                  the gold standard for pregnancy dating used by healthcare providers worldwide. The formula calculates 
                  280 days (40 weeks) from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP) or 266 days from conception 
                  date. However, only 4-5% of babies are born exactly on their estimated due date, with 60% born within 
                  1 week and 90% within 2 weeks of the calculated date. The American College of Obstetricians and 
                  Gynecologists (ACOG) endorses this method as the primary tool for establishing estimated due dates (EDD) 
                  in clinical practice.

                  Should I use LMP or conception date for due date calculation?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Both LMP (Last Menstrual Period) and conception date methods are medically valid for due date calculation. 
                  <strong>LMP Method:</strong> Clinical standard used by 95% of healthcare providers, calculates from first 
                  day of last period, works well with regular 28-day cycles. 
                  <strong>Conception Date Method:</strong> More accurate if you know exact fertilization date (from IVF, 
                  ovulation tracking, or single intercourse), calculates 266 days from conception. 
                  <strong>Best Accuracy:</strong> Early pregnancy ultrasound (8-13 weeks) provides superior accuracy (±5-7 days) 
                  compared to both LMP and conception calculations, especially for women with irregular cycles or uncertain dates. 
                  ACOG recommends adjusting due dates when ultrasound and LMP differ by more than 7 days in first trimester.

                  The optimal delivery window for healthy pregnancy outcomes spans 37-42 weeks gestational age, with 
                  refined classifications: 
                  <strong>Early Term (37-38 weeks):</strong> Safe but not optimal, associated with slightly higher respiratory issues. 
                  <strong>Full Term (39-40 weeks):</strong> Optimal timing with best maternal and fetal outcomes, lowest complication rates. 
                  <strong>Late Term (41 weeks):</strong> Still normal, but requires increased monitoring for fetal well-being. 
                  <strong>Post Term (42+ weeks):</strong> Increased risks of stillbirth, macrosomia, and placental insufficiency; 
                  induction typically recommended. 
                  <strong>Preterm ({'<'}37 weeks):</strong> Higher risks of respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, and NICU admission. 
                  Most healthcare providers recommend delivery between 39-41 weeks for optimal outcomes.

                <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Healthcare providers confirm and potentially adjust due dates during first prenatal appointments using 
                  evidence-based protocols: 
                  <strong>First Prenatal Visit (6-10 weeks):</strong> Review LMP date, cycle history, conception timing, 
                  physical exam for uterine size assessment. 
                  <strong>Dating Ultrasound (8-13 weeks):</strong> Most accurate window for gestational age assessment using 
                  crown-rump length (CRL) measurement, accurate within ±5-7 days. 
                  <strong>Due Date Adjustment Criteria:</strong> ACOG recommends changing EDD when first-trimester ultrasound 
                  differs from LMP by {'>'}7 days, second-trimester ultrasound differs by {'>'}10-14 days. 
                  <strong>Final Due Date:</strong> Established by 20 weeks and typically not changed thereafter unless 
                  significant medical indication exists. Multiple dating methods create the most reliable estimate.

                <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Irregular menstrual cycles significantly impact due date calculator accuracy and require modified approaches: 
                  <strong>Cycle Irregularity Definition:</strong> Cycles varying by {'>'}7-10 days monthly, cycles {'<'}21 or {'>'}35 days, 
                  unpredictable ovulation timing. 
                  <strong>Common Causes:</strong> PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), recent hormonal contraceptive use, 
                  breastfeeding, thyroid disorders, stress, weight changes. 
                  <strong>Accuracy Impact:</strong> LMP-based calculations may be off by 1-4 weeks with irregular cycles. 
                  <strong>Recommended Approach:</strong> Early dating ultrasound (8-10 weeks) becomes essential for accurate 
                  gestational age determination. 
                  <strong>Clinical Practice:</strong> Healthcare providers rely primarily on ultrasound dating when LMP 
                  is uncertain or cycles are irregular, following CDC and ACOG guidelines for optimal pregnancy management.

                <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Due date calculators predict key pregnancy milestones based on gestational age for optimal prenatal care: 
                  <strong>First Trimester Milestones:</strong> Week 6-8 (first prenatal visit, heartbeat detection), 
                  Week 11-14 (NT scan window, first trimester screening), Week 12 (end of first trimester, decreased miscarriage risk). 
                  <strong>Second Trimester Milestones:</strong> Week 15-20 (maternal serum screening), Week 18-22 (anatomy scan, 
                  gender determination), Week 20 (halfway point), Week 24 (viability milestone). 
                  <strong>Third Trimester Milestones:</strong> Week 28 (third trimester begins, glucose screening), Week 32-36 
                  (growth monitoring), Week 35-37 (Group B strep screening), Week 37 (full-term begins). 
                  <strong>Prenatal Care Schedule:</strong> Each milestone corresponds to specific prenatal appointments, screening 
                  tests, and monitoring protocols established by ACOG for comprehensive pregnancy management.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Multiple maternal and fetal factors influence actual delivery timing compared to calculated due dates: 
                  <strong>Maternal Factors:</strong> First pregnancy (primigravida) tends to deliver 1-2 days after due date, 
                  previous pregnancies (multigravida) may deliver earlier, maternal age {'>'}35 associated with slightly earlier delivery, 
                  pre-existing medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension) may necessitate earlier delivery. 
                  <strong>Fetal Factors:</strong> Baby's size and position, lung maturity, genetic factors influencing gestation length. 
                  <strong>Pregnancy Factors:</strong> Multiple pregnancies (twins average 36 weeks, triplets 32 weeks), 
                  placental function, amniotic fluid levels. 
                  <strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Stress levels, physical activity, nutrition, social support. 
                  <strong>Statistical Reality:</strong> Natural labor onset follows a bell curve distribution around the due date, 
                  with most deliveries occurring within the 37-42 week window.

                <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Healthcare providers use due date calculations for evidence-based labor and delivery management: 
                  <strong>Expectant Management (37-41 weeks):</strong> Natural labor awaiting with routine monitoring, 
                  weekly cervical checks after 36 weeks, fetal movement counting, non-stress tests if indicated. 
                  <strong>Post-term Management (41-42 weeks):</strong> Increased surveillance with biophysical profiles, 
                  amniotic fluid assessment, twice-weekly monitoring for fetal well-being. 
                  <strong>Induction Timing:</strong> Typically offered at 41-42 weeks to prevent post-term complications, 
                  earlier if medical conditions warrant intervention. 
                  <strong>Cesarean Planning:</strong> Scheduled cesareans typically performed at 39 weeks for optimal fetal 
                  lung maturity while avoiding emergency situations. 
                  <strong>Clinical Decision Making:</strong> Due dates guide timing of interventions, inform consent discussions, 
                  and help balance maternal-fetal risks with natural labor preferences.

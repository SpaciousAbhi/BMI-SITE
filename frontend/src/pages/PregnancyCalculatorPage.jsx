                  <strong>Use pregnancy calculators for initial estimates; ultrasound for medical confirmation.</strong> 
                  Pregnancy calculators work best for regular 26-32 day cycles with known LMP. Early ultrasound dating 
                  (6-12 weeks) provides ±3-5 day accuracy and is recommended when calculator and ultrasound differ by 
                  more than 7 days.

                <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Pregnancy calculators have limited accuracy with irregular cycles (variation {'>'}7 days monthly). 
                  For women with PCOS, long cycles ({'>'}35 days), or recent contraceptive use, LMP-based calculations 
                  may be off by 1-3 weeks. In these cases: (1) Use average cycle length if available, (2) Schedule 
                  early dating ultrasound (8-10 weeks) for accurate gestational age, (3) Healthcare providers may 
                  revise due dates based on ultrasound biometry, (4) Consider fertility awareness tracking for future 
                  pregnancies. CDC recommends ultrasound dating for all women with uncertain LMP or irregular cycles.

                <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  The pregnancy calculator divides pregnancy into three trimesters based on medical standards: 
                  First Trimester (Weeks 1-13): Organ formation, hormonal changes, morning sickness, fatigue, increased 
                  miscarriage risk until week 12. Second Trimester (Weeks 14-26): "Golden period" with increased energy, 
                  anatomy scan, first movements (quickening), gender determination. Third Trimester (Weeks 27-40): Rapid 
                  fetal growth, maternal discomfort increases, lung maturation, preparation for labor. Each trimester 
                  has specific maternal health recommendations, screening tests, and developmental expectations based 
                  on current obstetric practice guidelines.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Pregnancy calculator due date predictions using Naegele's rule have 95% reliability within ±14 days. 
                  However, natural birth timing varies significantly: Only 4-5% of babies born on exact due date, 60% 
                  born within 1 week of due date, 90% born within 2 weeks of due date. Factors affecting timing include: 
                  first pregnancy (often 1-2 days late), previous pregnancies (may deliver earlier), maternal age, baby's 
                  size and position, genetic factors. Healthcare providers consider 37-42 weeks as full-term, with induction 
                  typically recommended after 41-42 weeks to prevent complications.

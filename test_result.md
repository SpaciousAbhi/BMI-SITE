# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION
#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Ethnicity-Adjusted BMI Calculator (/ethnicity-bmi): Page loads successfully, comprehensive form functionality including ethnicity selection dropdown working, calculation results displaying properly (BMI 25.4, Obese category with 'East Asian Adjustments Applied'), extensive scientific content sections present, mobile and tablet responsive. ✅ MEDIUM PRIORITY PAGES: Homepage (/): Loads successfully with main BMI calculator, comprehensive feature showcase, navigation working. Athletes BMI (/athletes-bmi): Loads with sport-specific content. Body Fat Calculator (/body-fat): Loads with US Navy method. Calorie Calculator (/calories): Functional. Macros Calculator (/macros): Functional. Blog Section (/blog): Loads with 9 articles, search functionality working. ✅ MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS: Verified across all pages on mobile (390x844) and tablet (768x1024) viewports - all forms, buttons, and content properly accessible. ✅ INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS: Expandable sections, navigation buttons, FAQ sections, and form interactions all working properly. ✅ PERFORMANCE: All pages load quickly (500-1000ms), no critical console errors, no network errors. ✅ JSX SYNTAX FIXES VERIFIED: All pages render without parsing errors, forms functional, calculations working, no JavaScript errors blocking functionality. ✅ CONCLUSION: Comprehensive testing confirms all JSX syntax error fixes are successful. All high-priority specialized BMI calculators are fully functional with excellent user experience. The application is production-ready with no critical issues found."tific deep-dive sections) and have ZERO impact on backend functionality. ✅ CONCLUSION: Backend service remains fully operational and production-ready after the comprehensive content enhancements. All backend APIs working properly, environment variables correctly configured, MongoDB connection stable, and backend service can handle requests normally."

      message: "BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE AFTER JSX SYNTAX FIXES: ✅ TESTING SCOPE: Performed comprehensive backend API testing after JSX syntax error fixes in frontend pages (PregnancyBMIPage.js, SeniorBMIPage.js, EthnicityBMIPage.js) as requested in review. ✅ ENVIRONMENT RESTORATION: Recreated missing environment files (/app/backend/.env with MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017, DB_NAME=bmi_calculator, CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000 and /app/frontend/.env with REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001) that were causing backend startup failures. ✅ SERVICE HEALTH: Backend service restarted successfully and running on port 8001 via supervisor with no errors in logs. ✅ COMPREHENSIVE API TESTING: All 3 backend tests passed with 100% success rate using backend_test.py - Backend Health Check (GET /api/ returns {'message': 'Hello World'}), CORS Headers (proper cross-origin support with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000, Access-Control-Allow-Methods: DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT, Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type), Database Connectivity (MongoDB CRUD operations working perfectly). ✅ INDIVIDUAL ENDPOINT VERIFICATION: All API endpoints tested and confirmed working: GET /api/ (health check returns {'message': 'Hello World'}), POST /api/status (creates records with UUID, client_name, timestamp - tested with 'Backend Verification Test'), GET /api/status (retrieves all records as JSON array - confirmed multiple test records). ✅ DATABASE OPERATIONS: MongoDB connection stable with successful data persistence and retrieval - verified with multiple test records creation and retrieval operations. ✅ CORS CONFIGURATION: Headers properly configured for frontend communication with localhost:3000 origin support. ✅ FRONTEND PAGE VERIFICATION: Verified that PregnancyBMIPage.js, SeniorBMIPage.js, and EthnicityBMIPage.js exist and are properly structured React components with no syntax errors. ✅ IMPACT ASSESSMENT: JSX syntax fixes in frontend pages are purely frontend code corrections and have ZERO impact on backend functionality. ✅ CONCLUSION: Backend service is completely unaffected by the JSX syntax fixes and remains fully operational and production-ready. All backend APIs working properly, environment variables correctly configured, MongoDB connection stable, and backend service can handle requests normally."
